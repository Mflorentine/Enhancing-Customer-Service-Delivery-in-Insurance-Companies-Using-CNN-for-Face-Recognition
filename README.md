This project is based on the published research article: “Enhancing Customer Service Delivery in Insurance Companies Using Convolutional Neural Network for Face Recognition: Evidence from Rwanda.” Published in International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology, 2024.
Features:
    Automated customer identification using facial recognition
    Fraud prevention through biometric verification
    Efficient service delivery using AI‑powered identity matching
    MTCNN for face detection and VGGFace for recognition
    SQLite databases for secure client data storage
    Streamlit interface for image upload, webcam input, and results display
    Can integrate with existing insurance information systems
Technologies Used:
    Python
    Multi‑Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks (MTCNN)
    VGGFace model
    SQLite Database
    Streamlit
    Deep Learning / Convolutional Neural Networks
Model Performance:
    The developed system achieves 96% accuracy, performing better than several existing face recognition approaches and demonstrating strong reliability for real‑world insurance workflows in Rwanda. 
Use case: 
    Insurance companies often struggle with client identification during service delivery, especially when documentation is missing or when fraud attempts occur. This system helps:
    Identify clients using facial biometrics
    Improve service efficiency
    Reduce fraud risks
    Enhance customer experience
